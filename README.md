SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
  Our system will use the foundations from DoSOCS to scan not only for license informtaion but for dependancies within open source files.   The system will store the scanned licesensing information ino the SPDX database. It will check the database before scanning to           determine if the files have already been scanned by using SHA256 cashing.
